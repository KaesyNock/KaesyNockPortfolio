								Hi, as we&apos;ve covered I&apos;m Kaesy Nock. I am a full stack
								developer. Beyond being a developer I&apos;m the World&apos;s
								most alrightiest person. How the heck did I get here you ask?
								<p>
									Growing up I never fit into one category. I&apos;m the first
									granddaughter of my generation (on my Mom&apos;s side) after
									four grandsons. Being a tomboy and keeping up with the boys
									was survival. I played sports and was definitely a Gym Class
									Hero (I said it).
								</p>
								<p>
									But my brothers and I spent all of our extra time in the art
									room- even down to getting extra class credits for years
									because we taught classmates how to use Photoshop (CS4 because
									ancient)- we had been using it at home since Photoshop 6.0.
								</p>
								<p>
									When we were home and in our rooms we would build websites for
									hours and hours- Angelfire or Expage were constants on our
									screens. I cannot tell you how many times &quot;HTML for
									Dummies&quot; was fought over growing up.
								</p>
								<p>
									When we weren&apos;t at home we were at local punk rock shows
									and started creating websites and portfolios for local bands.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then adulthood happened and instead of staying the course I
									spent 15 years as a hairstylist. I spent years upon years at
									every spa or salon I worked at setting up all of the
									hardware/software/infrastructure and building their websites.
									Sweat equity I happily did for free.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then 2020 happened and in the blink of an eye I saw a decade
									and a half of blood, sweat, and tears go down the drain
									through no fault of my own (a very common story I&apos;m
									sure). I couldn&apos;t go back. I tried, I failed miserably. I
									was just done. But I always had this niggling little thought
									in the back of my head that I always wanted to do software.
								</p>
								<p>
									My husband (boyfriend at the time) convinced me to go to a
									Bootcamp during the Pandemic. At the beginning it was the
									hardest education I ever had. It took me MONTHS to be able to
									rewire my brain. To understand that computers are dumb and
									want the literal. To understand that you&apos;re in control.
									That we have the power of the unlimited- that we can create,
									build, or destroy worlds within the click of the keys. I got
									there. I learned. I grew. I was hooked.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now I&apos;m in control & I&apos;m building my own Future.
