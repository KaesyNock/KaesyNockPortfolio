Hi, as we've covered I'm Kaesy Nock. I am a full stack
developer. Beyond being a developer I'm the World's
most alrightiest person. How the heck did I get here you ask?

Growing up I never fit into one category. I'm the first
granddaughter of my generation (on my Mom's side) after
four grandsons. Being a tomboy and keeping up with the boys
was survival. I played sports and was definitely a Gym Class
Hero (I said it).

But my brothers and I spent all of our extra time in the art
room- even down to getting extra class credits for years
because we taught classmates how to use Photoshop (CS4 because
ancient)- we had been using it at home since Photoshop 6.0.

When we were home and in our rooms we would build websites for
hours and hours- Angelfire or Expage were constants on our
screens. I cannot tell you how many times "HTML for
Dummies" was fought over growing up.

When we weren't at home we were at local punk rock shows
and started creating websites and portfolios for local bands.

Then adulthood happened and instead of staying the course I
spent 15 years as a hairstylist. I spent years upon years at
every spa or salon I worked at setting up all of the
hardware/software/infrastructure and building their websites.
Sweat equity I happily did for free.

Then 2020 happened and in the blink of an eye I saw a decade
and a half of blood, sweat, and tears go down the drain
through no fault of my own (a very common story I'm
sure). I couldn't go back. I tried, I failed miserably. I
was just done. But I always had this niggling little thought
in the back of my head that I always wanted to do software.

My husband (boyfriend at the time) convinced me to go to a
Bootcamp during the Pandemic. At the beginning it was the
hardest education I ever had. It took me MONTHS to be able to
rewire my brain. To understand that computers are dumb and
want the literal. To understand that you're in control.
That we have the power of the unlimited- that we can create,
build, or destroy worlds within the click of the keys. I got
there. I learned. I grew. I was hooked.

Now I'm in control & I'm building my own Future.
