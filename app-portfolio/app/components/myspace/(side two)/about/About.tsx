							Hi! My I&apos;m Kaesy and I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer
							orginally from Rochester, NY.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-2 indent-5">
							Why a MySpace format you ask? I&apos;m a big fan of not remaking
							the wheel. I love UI but as a Developer my goal is first to design
							a product that is going to be clear, concise, and to deliver the
							viewer the necessary info in a ledgeable format. I figured MySpace
							is my generation&apos;s first and best template website so I
							thought I&apos;d throw it back on this one. Later on I&apos;ll
							attach a website that&apos;s got graphics and is heavily
							interactive to show off my skill set but as my mentors always say
						  &quot;KISS IT&quot;.

						  And yes, I am completely aware of the irony of quoting Alan Kay speaking in terms of the future
						  while looking at a website style that is two decades old. Rebel.
