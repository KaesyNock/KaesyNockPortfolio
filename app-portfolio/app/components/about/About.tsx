						<p className="mt-2 ">
							Hi! My I&apos;m Kaesy and I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer
							orginally from Rochester, NY.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-2 indent-5">
							<span className="font-bold">Why a MySpace format you ask?</span>{" "}
							I&apos;m a big fan of not remaking the wheel. I love UI but as a
							Developer my goal is first to design a product that is going to be
							clear, concise, and to deliver the viewer the necessary info in a
							ledgeable format. I figured MySpace is my generation&apos;s first
							and best template website so I thought I&apos;d throw it back on
							this one. Later on I&apos;ll attach a website that&apos;s got
							graphics and is heavily interactive to show off my skill set but
							as my mentors always say &quot;KISS IT&quot;.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							And yes, I am completely aware of the irony of quoting Alan Kay
							speaking in terms of the future while looking at a website style
							that is two decades old. Rebel.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							<span className="font-bold">
								Why am I building my website like this?</span> Tech land has always been a market for the engineer brain. Most of
							us could probably be accused (and rightfully so) of thinking more
							like a computer than a man. I&apos;ve had so many discussions over
							the years about the developer brain (or anyone in the field
							really) and language. I think it&apos;s safe to say when we all
							start our careers we struggle with computer versus human thought.
							Human communication and the stimuli/response cycle is so
							predisposed to nuance, inference, and assumption. An amalgamation
							of years and decades of sociological experiences, backgrounds,
							environment, and so much more. As humans we have no idea how much
							our speech is impacted by our lives.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							The problem? That ALL goes out the window the second you try to
							communicate with a computer (and when I say computer I mean in the
							most general of terms- anything capable of a binary
							stimuli/response cycle). It tends to rewire your neural pathways
							in a way that makes average communication with other humans a
							difficult, often tedious process.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							<span className="font-bold">Why am I bringing this up?</span> I
							decided to do a personality based website over a tech heavy
							website because you can ALWAYS teach technology. You can teach
							project management, time management, documentation, scaling,
							planning, and career growth.{" "}
							<span className="font-bold">
								What you cannot teach is personality, being a good team member,
								interpersonal communication, integrity, or trust.
							</span>{" "}
							I wanted to show off what sets me apart from most developers.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							While most have spent years in this industry, I spent the first 15
							years in the job market in the people industry. Being a
							stylist/managing high-end salons and spas/owning my own businesses
							has given me an incredibly unique approach to this industry. My
							entire job revolved around communication, proper consultations
							(because lets not forget when you&apos;re putting chemicals that
							have a pH of 13 on someone&apos;s scalp they better know the
							risks/outcomes), and working within every aspect of human emotions
							(often times you&apos;re their therapist or the one they&apos;re
							complaining to). You tend to nail down the people skills after a
							while.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							Beyond that I come from a huge family (Dad is one of 11, Mom is
							one of 8) which means having a sense of humor, being able to take
							criticism, POLITELY make your points and understand the crucial
							through the noise- is survival.
						</p>
						<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
							<span className="font-bold">tl;dr</span>: You can be great at tech
							and have no clue how to communicate with your team. I&apos;m a
							well rounded developer who is just as adept at speaking to the
							tech as I am at speaking to the team.
						</p>

							really have mobile optimization in 2008 sooo true to history at
							least?

							*Projects and Blogs are coming. I recently took several
							illuminating courses and I am now taking the time to refine all of
							my favorite projects. Thank you for your patience.

						Who I&apos;d Like to Work For:
					</h3>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						This industry is full to the brim with excellent, amazing, world
						class developers. I wanted a portfolio website that told my truth. I
						might be at the earlier stages of my career but you will never find
						an employee more dedicated, more willing to try, to grow, to want to
						learn and be better. My competition is only myself yesterday. I want
						to find a job that wants to help me grow, but that also appreciates
						having a team player.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						I want to be part of a team that values each member. That has a
						leader whose primary goal is to build the strongest team possible. I
						want a job where I can follow my senior&apos;s advice and leadership
						so that I can improve my skills day after day. I want a team who is
						as driven and forward thinking as I am. I want to learn the cutting
						edge but I want to learn HOW we got here as an industry. I want to
						know the history of our industry. I want to learn it all. Above all
						I want to work where I can keep my head down and build clean,
						scalable, security conscious code that can make my company and my
						team members&apos; lives more cohesive, efficient, and easier.

						Why You Should Want to Hire Me:
					</h3>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						Although my skill level sits rougly between a Junior and a Mid (Mid
						in tech abilities, jJunior in working with a team.) I have had
						rigorous training with two high level mentors.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						My one <span className="font-bold"> Mentor </span>(my husband and
						the person who convinced me to get into tech) is an{" "}
						<span className="font-bold">
							ISSO, AWS SME, AWS Global Hero, Scrum Master, and Principal
							Architect/DevSecOps Engineer.{" "}
						</span>{" "}
						My other <span className="font-bold">Mentor</span> is a{" "}
						<span className="font-bold">
							Principal Data Engineer, Backend Developer, AI Developer, and AWS Solutions Architect.{" "}
						</span>
						My Mentors are World Class Engineers (literally) who have set me on
						a path to incredible success.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						They have taught me the ins and outs of this industry including:{" "}
						<span className="font-bold">
							Best Practices, Requirements Gathering, Standards, Agile
							Methodologies, Documentation
						</span>
						, etc. They&apos;ve taught me about the most common pot holes that
						every developer falls into, they&apos;ve taught me
						<span className="font-bold">
							&quot;KISS IT&quot;, The Dunning-Kruger Effect
						</span>{" "}
						(I would like to think I&apos;m heading back up the Slope of
						Englightenment), that most developers know a ton about software but
						not nearly as much about hardware.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						I have been quizzed at 2AM on the
						<span className="font-bold"> Powers of 2 and The OSI Model </span>
						(What the Layer is, What is does, Who it communicates to, and an
						example of tech on each layer). I&apos;ve gotten history lessons on
						everything from <span className="font-bold"> ARPANET</span> to the
						origins of <span className="font-bold"> IANA </span> (the ruling
						body who assigns port numbers and protocol; socket numbers if
						we&apos;re still talking ARPANET). I&apos;ve learned what my
						standards should be.
						<span className="font-bold">
							I&apos;ve learned that as Developers we should always develop the
							most efficient, scalable, clean code possible.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p className="mt-2 indent-5">
						I&apos;ve spent years listening to their biggest frustrations with
						the development side of the industry. I know what the conversations
						at the C-Suite Level look like, how decisions are made. I&apos;ve
						seen the designs and deployment of some of the most cutting edge
						technologies and some of the most fundamental technologies. I know
						how much pressure sits on Principal and Seniors&apos; shoulders. I
						know how something as simple as extra spaces in code can end up
						costing thousands in unneccesary storage costs. Or how tech debt and
						poor organization can end up costing untold amounts.{" "}
						<span className="font-bold">
							I only know how to have high standards because my education has
							only included the highest of standards. You should hire me because
							I will be a phenomal developer- I just need a bit more corporate
							experience under my belt.
